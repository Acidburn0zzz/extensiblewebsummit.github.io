{"name":"Extensible Web Summit","tagline":"A Series of Events Focusing on the Future of Web Technology and Standards","body":"### What is the Extensible Web Summit?\r\n\r\nA “summit” sounds important, but what we are really talking about is bringing together people from a diverse set of interests and backgrounds to talk about the future of web technologies. This includes concepts put forward in the [Extensible Web Manifesto](https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org) but is not limited to those concepts.  The event is a chance for web developers, web platform developers and developers focusing on standards to come together in an informal context to discuss new approaches, suggest new work, highlight issues and generally discuss the state of the web platform and its continued evolution.\r\n\r\nThe format of the event is that of an “[unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference),” preceded by curated lightning talks to set the scene.  The events are free to attend and depend heavily in participant engagement.  After the lightning talks, participants create the schedule for the rest of the day which will consist of a set of parallel breakout sessions. Breakout session discussions will be moderated and will be minuted, with the intention of informing future work.\r\n\r\n### Next Extensible Web Summit\r\nWatch this space for news of our next event.\r\n\r\n### Past Events\r\n[Extensible Web Summit San Francisco](http://lanyrd.com/2015/extwebsummit/) - April 2015 – Hosted by FluentConf  \r\n[Extensible Web Summit Oakland](http://lanyrd.com/2014/extwebsummit-berlin/) - December 2014  \r\n[Extensible Web Summit Berlin](http://lanyrd.com/2014/extwebsummit-berlin/) - August 2014 – Hosted by Beuth University  \r\n[Extensible Web Summit San Francisco](http://lanyrd.com/2014/extensible-web-summit/) – April 2014 – Hosted by Adobe  \r\n\r\n### Who Organizes the Extensible Web Summit?\r\n\r\nThe first Extensible Web Summit was organized by members of the @w3ctag.
